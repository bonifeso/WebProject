        Common Attacks
    </h1>
    <p>
        Cyberattacks are a prevalent and ever-evolving threat to
        individuals, organizations, and governments worldwide. <br>
        These attacks can take various forms, each with its distinct methods and objectives. <br>
        Understanding the common types of cyberattacks is crucial for implementing effective cybersecurity
         measures and minimizing the risk of falling victim to these threats.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Here are some of the most common types of cyberattacks:</h3>
    
    <h2>Malware:</h2>
    <p>
        This is a broad term for any malicious software designed to harm a computer system.<br>
         Malware can include viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, and ransomware.
    </p>

    <h2>Phishing:</h2>
    <p>
        This is a type of social engineering attack where attackers try to trick victims into 
        revealing personal information or clicking on malicious links.<br>
         Phishing attacks often come in the form of fake emails or text 
         messages that appear to be from a legitimate source.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:</h2>
    <p>
        In an MITM attack, the attacker intercepts communication between two parties
         and can eavesdrop on or even modify the data being exchanged.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks:</h2>
    <p>
        DoS attacks attempt to overwhelm a system with traffic so that it can no longer function properly.<br> 
        This can make websites and services unavailable to legitimate users.
    </p>

    <h2>Password attacks:</h2>
    <p>
        These attacks try to gain unauthorized access to accounts by guessing or cracking passwords.
    </p>

    <h2>SQL injection attacks:</h2>
    <p>
        This type of attack allows attackers to enter malicious code into a website's database,
         allowing them to steal data or gain control of the site.
    </p>

    <h2>Zero-day exploits:</h2>
    <p>
        These are attacks that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in software. <br>
        These types of attacks are particularly dangerous because there is no patch available to fix the vulnerability.
    </p>

    <h2>Spoofing:</h2>
    <p>
        Spoofing is a type of attack where the attacker disguises themself as a legitimate user 
        or device in order to gain access to a system or data.
    </p>

    <h2>Social engineering:</h2>
    <p>
        This is a broad term for any attack that relies on tricking the victim into performing an action that benefits the attacker. <br>
        This can include phishing attacks, bait-and-switch attacks, and pretexting.
    </p>

    <p>
        These are just a few of the many different types of cyberattacks that exist.<br>
         By understanding these attacks and how they work, individuals and organizations can take steps to protect themselves from being victimized.
