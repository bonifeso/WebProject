    <h2>What is security awareness?</h2>
    <p>
        
        Security awareness is the knowledge and understanding of security risks and
        measures that individuals and organizations possess.<br>
        It encompasses the ability to identify, assess, and respond to security threats, 
        as well as the adoption of safe practices to protect sensitive information and assets.<br>
        In the context of cybersecurity, security awareness plays a crucial role in 
        mitigating cyber threats and minimizing the likelihood of successful attacks. <br>
        Understand what it takes to be security conscious by walking through the most 
        common attacks seen in the industry, 
        and learn how to mitigate potential threats.<br>
        Based on a report from IBM, 
        human errors were the main reason for 95% of successful cyber attacks.<br>
        The study concluded that people are the main threat to the security of a business.<br>
        Being more security-aware will significantly help mitigate potential
        threats and risks to your organization.<br>
